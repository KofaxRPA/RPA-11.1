You can also use this user to log into Design Studio, but you *should* create other users for that.

# Creating Users
* in **ManagementConsole/Admin/Users&Groups** create a group called **developers**.
* Create an account for each Design Studio user and add it to the group **developers**.
* Open the **Default Project** in **ManagementConsole/Admin/Projects** by clicking **â‹®** before the project name.

You can add LDAP for user management, and you should also create users and groups for the Roboservers, Synchronizers, MC Admins, Kapplet Admins, API access, Password Managers, Desktop Accounts, etc. See the documentation for further details.
See [Robot Lifecycle Management Guide](https://github.com/KofaxRPA/Robot-Lifecycle-Management-Guide/releases) for step-by-step instructions of creating many of these accounts.

# How to log-out of Design Studio
